This is a userscript designed for the [Path of Exile forum](https://www.pathofexile.com/forum).

It requires a userscript manager such as Tampermonkey ([Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/tampermonkey/), [Chrome / Chromium-based](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo?hl=en)) to use.

It was created in response to a request by [Clownkrieger](https://www.pathofexile.com/account/view-profile/Clownkrieger) and is configured to hide the Feedback and Suggestions & General Discussion forum sections by default, as those are the ones specified by that person. It should be easy enough to figure out how to change it to fit your own preferences, however feel free to ask if you'd like me to offer you a modified version.
